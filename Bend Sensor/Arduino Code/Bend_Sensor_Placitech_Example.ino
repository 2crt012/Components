 *  Use this code to learn the basics of Bend Sensors. In this example
 *  you will create a voltage divider placing a 2.2 KÎ© resistor in series
 *  with the bend sensor. Since the resistance of the sensor varies depending
 *  on how much you bend it (the more pressure, the less resistance), you will
 *  use the serial monitor to check the change in voltage and turn on/off an LED
 *  depending on a certain threshold.
 *  
 *  The microcontroller I used for this example is an Arduino Nano, but you
 *  can use any Micro that you have, like the Arduino UNO or MEGA.
